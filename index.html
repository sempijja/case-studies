People face many unique barriers to physical activity, such as physical limitations, geographic and environmental constraints, lack of resources or income, social pressures, fixed mindsets, and health beliefs, and more. Many existing health tools embrace a “one-size-fits-all” approach, assuming standard graphs and statistics will work for everyone. In this studio, we'll explore tools to address these unique barriers. How can we promote physical activity across demographics and abilities? How do we foster long-term, sustainable habits? And how do we bridge geographic and economic gaps in access to exercise?</td>

Wade has had major consequences for peoples’ access to reproductive healthcare and has raised concerns about data privacy in personal health apps. Due to increased demand for OBGYN care, patients must often wait months for care at a women's health clinic.

                    However, concerns about long wait times and data security are issues that most Americans have, especially low-income people who often have a limited number of providers who accept medicare and/or medicaid.

So how is it that, as the music world grows bigger and widens our domain for potential connection, meaningful music-based connections seem to be harder to attain?
                    In the music industry, collaboration is key — a lead singer might have assembled a band that needs a drummer, a songwriter might need an extra pair of ears on an unreleased single, or a listener of a niche genre might want to connect with others who appreciate it.

Even small tasks may inadvertently lead to a high energy expenditure if the path to completion is overly complicated.
